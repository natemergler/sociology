# Sociology
A website to organize notes for AICE Sociology.

Notes are all in the javascript file (currently titled _definitions.js_). All definitions and terms are in an object , _def_, and then are referenced in the articles in the other objects. This will reduce repetition in using repeated definitions.

<ins>Project has been temporarily put aside, as I have finished the class. This will most likely remain as a starting point for other projects.
The database should be completely seperate from the cource code and easier to read</ins>
